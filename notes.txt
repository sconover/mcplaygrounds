add to dotfile:
  repo urls + branches to use for various repos

commands:
  print-settings
  set key value
    ...must be a valid setting
    ...regex validation?

keep a "data" dir that separated from all the code and artifacts,
that contains any human work, that we symlink into from elsewhere.
  e.g. code and other written artifacts
